# Tracked/untracked group

The `Tracked/Untracked` group is a special group designed to monitor the total power consumption of individual power sensors, referred to as the tracked group.

You can also specify a `main_power_sensor`, which will be used to calculate the `untracked` consumption. This is determined by subtracting the power consumption of the tracked group from the total power consumption.

After configuration you'll end up with two additional sensors:

- `sensor.tracked_power`
- `sensor.untracked_power` (only when `main_power_sensor` is specified)

Additionally energy sensors and utility meters can be created for the tracked and untracked group.
Just toggle these options in the configuration screen.

## Create group with GUI

You can create the group with the GUI using this button.

[![config_flow_start](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=powercalc)

When this is not working.

- Go to `Settings` -> `Devices & Services`
- Click `Add integration`
- Search and click `Powercalc`

Select `Group` -> `Tracked/Untracked` and follow the instructions.

!!! note

    Powercalc will only allow a single instance of this group in your installation

## Auto mode

The `Tracked/Untracked` group can be configured in `auto` mode.
This will try to automatically add all power sensors to the tracked group from you HA instance.

- All enabled power sensors with a `device_class` of `power` will be added to the tracked group.
- Excluding powercalc groups and the `main_power_sensor` if specified.

Whenever a new power sensor is added or removed to your HA instance, the tracked group will update accordingly.

If you prefer more granular control, you can disable auto mode and manually manage the sensors in the tracked group.
During configuration, the list of sensors will initially match the auto mode setup, but youâ€™ll be able to modify it as needed.

!!! note

    In manual mode, you must update the group manually whenever power sensors are added or removed from your system.
