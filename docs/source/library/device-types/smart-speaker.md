# Smart speaker

Smart speakers are devices that can play music, answer questions, and control smart home devices. They are often used in combination with voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Siri.
Powercalc profiles define power usage per volume level, this will give a pretty accurate indication of the power usage of the device.
However for speakers which have a high power output, the estimated power usage can be a bit off depending on the music played.

## Measure

To integrate a smart speaker with Powercalc, the [measure tool](../../contributing/measure.md) provides a mode to measure it's power consumption.
It does that by playing pink noise at different volumes and measuring the power consumption.

After starting the measure tool, select `Smart speaker` in the first step of the wizard.

The process will take less than 5 minutes to complete.

!!! note

    Amazon Alexa devices do not support streaming pink noise MP3 directly. To circumvent this you can manually stream pink noise using Spotify or any other streaming service.
    For Spotify you can use: https://open.spotify.com/track/1H6TQatZRjQ4edzz0jsOqk?si=3ba2040261054fca
    Make sure to disable streaming in the measure tool, you can select this in the wizard.
