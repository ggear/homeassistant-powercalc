# Entity Category

The `power_entity_category` and `energy_entity_category` settings define the entity category for the created power and energy sensors.

In most cases, you won't need to change these. However, setting them to `diagnostic` can be helpful if you want to hide Powercalc sensors from automatically generated dashboards, especially when many sensors are created.
